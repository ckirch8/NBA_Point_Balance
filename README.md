Point Balance (PB) is a metric introduced by Stephen Shea and Christopher Baker in their 2013 book, Basketball Analytics. It measures how balanced a team is in scoring, a high score means the team has a high distribution of scoring vs a low score which tells us only a few players do most of the scoring.

I wrote this code to be able to see if point balance has any correlation with the success of an NBA team. Full writeup can be found [here].
